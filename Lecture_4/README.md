# Intro to CSS

-

Let's talk about **CSS**, or **Cascading Style SHeets**, the language that allows us to define styles and adjustments to default content on our webpages.

-


#### Absolute VS Relative URLs

Before getting into the specifics, let's talk about linking our code to HTML.

```html
<head>
	<!-- include css file in your webpage -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">
</head>
```

-

Absolute/Relative URLs (or as they are sometimes called, **paths**).

**Absolute URL**
A URL that contains the **full path**. For example, **[https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)** is an example of an absolute URL. 
Contains both the **hostname** and the **full path** to file.

-

**Relative URL**
A URL that contains only a fragment of the full address. For example, **[/nu/textarea](/nu/textarea)**. 

**NOTE**: this won't actually work! However, the people in **https://validator.w3.org** would be able to use this correctly **because relative URLs use the hostname of the page they are on**.

-

**When to use each type**

In general, if you are linking to an image or some other resource that lives on the internet, use **absolute paths**.

When you are linking to something like **CSS stylesheets** or **javascript files** or **images that live on your servere** you should **definitely** use relative paths.

-

#### Intro to CSS
**Basic Definition**
Method for searching your html tags efficiently and styling the results it finds.

-

** Three ways to CSS **
1. This way is evil, we won't even talk about it.
2. This way is also not very good, we won't even talk about it.
3. This way is ideal! let's discuss how to link in external files to your index.html...
** Selectors **
**SELECTOR**: a keyword used to query your html tags, classes, ids -- (the last two are html attributes)
**RULES**: the style attributes you are going to set
**[CHEAT LINK](http://fewdmaterials.github.io/Lecture2FEWD71/selectors_and_specificity.html)**

-

### Exercises
Here are the main problems that we will aspire to be able to solve in this section.

-

#### Problem 1
**[Consider this repo](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/RelativePathsReview)**.
You are given several "websites". However they are set up in strange configurations! 
**For Each Folder**
1. **WITHOUT** rearranging the files, link the proper css folders in the **`HEAD`** section
2. If you do it right, hovering over the page in the browser will cause it to change colors

# Practical CSS3 Usecases

-

These are examples of CSS3 uses that we will either cover **today** or **at some point** in the duration of the course.

-

#### CSS Use Cases
Here are some interesting use cases where CSS3 in particular becomes super handy.

-

#### Animations
You can do some really awesome work with animating your elements.
* **[Spinner](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/42730)**
* **[Repeating, multiple animations](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4270)**

-

#### Transitions
Transitions are animations that are triggered usually by some form of user interaction.
* **[Hover Effects](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4268)**

-

#### Pseudo Selectors
Psuedo classes allow us to style specific types of element features, **i.e.** the **:hover** pseudo selector can be used to style an element as the user puts his mouse over it.
* **[Menu Hover Effect](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4957)**
Other examples of pseudo selectors: **:visited**, **:after**, etc

-

#### Overflows
Keep track of content and determine how it should behave if there is more content than space in the container.
* **[Overflow Example](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4165)**

-

#### Grids
This one is super expansive and you could literally teach an entire course on this. For now, take a look at a few examples / problems to gain perspective on this.
* **[Vertically and Horizontally Center](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10099)**
* **[Three Column Grid](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4258)**
* **[Flex Align/Justify](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10100)**
* **[Flex Direction](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10097)**
* **[Flex Wrap](http://fewd.us/jargon/#/problem/10098)**

-

#### Exercise
See if you can implement some of the more simple ones outlined here into one of your websites (either the resume or the Wendy Bite).

## Box Model
ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

-

The Box Model is a way of thinking about CSS DOM elements on the page. Instead of thinking of HTML elements as bits of HTML wrappers we style, we can think of them as boxes with specific dimensions and properties. Given this though, an HTML layout can be thought of as boxes within boxes.

-

#### Margin, Padding, Border
![box model](http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif)

* **Margin**: space in **between** DOM elements
* **Padding**: space **within** the DOM element
* **Border**: the outline **around** the DOM Element.

In general, the width of a DOM element is **padding** + **border** + **content**.

-

#### Implications
The main implications of this has to do with building **rows** with multiple tags / items inside of it. 
The widths adding up to 100% isn't enough -- the **width** + **padding** + **border** + **margin** must add up to 100%!

-

#### Box Sizing
This is a useful tool. We can use box-sizing to force the padding to be **pulled into** our content width. This way, padding is **not** added to the overall width.
**Types**: content-box, border-box
