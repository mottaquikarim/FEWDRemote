# FEWD: Final Project

---


### Description

For the final project, you'll be designing and building a website of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of front-end web development and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a website that you can add to your portfolio.  You could create: a portfolio website; a marketing website for a startup or business; or a prototype for a simple web-app. Work with your instructor and EIR's to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.

We recommend you take a look at the [GA Gallery](http:/gallery.ga.co) for examples of past student work.

### Evaluation / Submission

Students will create a new repository on GitHub for their final project and push their code to this new repository when they are ready to submit. The instructional team will grade each technical requirement and provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2).  **Note**: If bullet points have child bullets, the instructional team should grade the child bullets and not the parent bullet belonging to the child. The maximum possible score on this assignment is 22/22. Bonus sections are completely optional.
