 // now add the class pink to all your .tags elements so you can visually differentiate


// using the .find() method on var tags, please find all anchor tags

// using the .find() method on var anchors, find all span tags

// now add the class gray to all your <span> elements so you can visually differentiate


// console.log out var spans - what do you see? can you think of a test we can do,
// with an if statement, that could reliably tell us if any items with your selector was found?
// (this is food for though - don't have to write an actual answer)
