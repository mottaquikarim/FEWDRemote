**Due**: Tuesday April 17th, midnight

## Shopping List Implementation
**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**
1. Please solve Problems 1-5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 (problems are numbered within **app.js** folder
2. If you open the **index.html** file, you will see a bunch of tests. As you successfully solve the problems, the tests should begin to **PASS**. Your goal is to make the tests for the problems you are solving pass.
3. To access content, please **FORK** this **[project](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/JSR_Shopping_List_Functions)**.
4. Submission is simple: just redeploy to Github Pages and share with Courtney + me.

**NOTE**: IGNORE the instructions on the project page itself, they are a bit more advanced, meant for my Javascript Development class.

## Extra / For Fun

Implement this **[Batman Game](https://fewdmaterials.github.io/BatmanGame/)**. Read the instructions **carefully**. You are to publish your commits to github and submit the end URL (which should have a "game" where Batman can move and jump) to slack, as per usual.
