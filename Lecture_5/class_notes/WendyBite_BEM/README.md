# Wendy Bite BEM Assignment

You are to recreate the HOME page attached in the assignmentMaterials folder.

You should create an index.html, an assets/ directory, and a styles/ directory on the same level as assignmentMaterials. Make sure the image of Wendy is placed in the assets/ directory.

Good luck!
