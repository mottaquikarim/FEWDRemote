# Relative Paths Problems

## SCENE

You are given a bunch of webpage folders. However, they are set up in strange configurations. (Depending on the app you are building, sometimes this is warranted).

### For Each Folder

1. WITHOUT rearranging the files, link the proper css folders in the HEAD section
2. If you do it right, hovering over the page in the browser will cause it to change colors
