You can start with this HTML **[boilerplate](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/boilerplate-plain)**

ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

-

**Requirements**

* Use **[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)** API to query current weather conditions for your city / locality
* Use **[GiphyAPI](https://developers.giphy.com/)** to then query for a gif that describes current weather condition returned from OpenWeatherMap.
* Once both data points have been resolved, display gif and weather conditions on screen for user

## Final Projects

Let's take the remaining class time for final projects - as needed, Courtney and I can hop in to assist with specific questions.

**PLEASE** send **ME** a link to your deployed project by tonight!!

-

**REMINDER**:

* your final project MUST be deployed to Github Pages
* you are to simply demo your project and talk through plugins you've used, interesting problems you faced and how you solved them.
* Each person will spend about 5-7 minutes (tops) presenting. Your classmates may ask questions after your demo your project...but this is not a technical presentation (ie: no need to show code, unless you want to!)
